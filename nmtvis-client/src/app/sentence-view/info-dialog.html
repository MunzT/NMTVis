    <h2>What is Beam Search?</h2>
    <div>
        Beam Search shows you a tree with possible translations.
        Each translation starts with the Start-of-Sequence (SOS) token and ends with the End-of-Sequence (EOS) token.
        A path from SOS to EOS is a possible translation.
        By clicking on an EOS node, the translation will be highlighted and marked as the correct translation.
    </div>

    <h2>How to make corrections?</h2>
    <div>
        Follow the translations from left ro right, if you think a translation is wrong,
        click on the last node that is still correct, and possible alternatives will appear.
        With the keyboard, simple navigate through the translations using the arrow keys <kbd>←</kbd> <kbd>→</kbd> <kbd>↑</kbd>
        <kbd>↓</kbd>, <kbd>TAB</kbd> and <kbd>BACKSPACE</kbd>.
        Press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to show alternative translations, or just type to make a custom correction.
